## Information about data for ps4

The data used for ps4 is based on the publicly available tax-records from SKAT. The file clean_data.ipynb shows you how the raw data files are cleaned.
The raw data necessary can be downloaded directly from SKAT (https://www.sktst.dk/aktuelt/skatteoplysninger-for-selskaber/).

Anders Munk-Nielsen at the Department of Economics have a public github repository with a collection of publicly available datasets (https://github.com/AndersMunkN/PublicData), which includes the tax records (Central Business Register).
Many publicly available datasets are not that simple to work with once you try it out. So the idea is to write some code so that the datasets are ready to go for an econometric analysis. 
I recommend you to have a look at his repo, this is a great resource for data for e.g. bsc thesis.
